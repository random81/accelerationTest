# accelerationTest
This is an android program. This is a little program meant to experiment with using the accelerometer sensor data.
I worked on it for fun a few years ago. There is calculus in it which was the more interesting part of the implementation and the heart of it.The calculus section is located in CaliberateActivity.java. My calculus approach to getting the area under the graph is different here than what I learned in theory beause I used discrete data points to create a triangle of the area under the two data points and then a rectangle underneath added to that triangle area. 
The app is not finished at all but was more of a proof of concept prototype.
